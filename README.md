Descryption of task: Here again I have used netbeans IDE To this task.And some dependidies I have add here.A REST API client is a tool or software component that allows users or applications to interact with a web service through the HTTP protocol by sending and receiving data. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and it is commonly used to develop web services due to its simplicity and scalability. A REST API client is designed to help users make requests to a REST API and handle responses, typically in formats like JSON or XML.
